## Codebase Patterns
- trip-planner-web is at /home/lcc/yopki/trip-planner-web (monorepo with turbo)
- Commit messages must be lowercase after `feat:` (commitlint enforced)
- `npx playwright install --with-deps` requires sudo on Arch Linux; use `npx playwright install` without system deps flag
- Playwright browsers have a host validation warning for missing system libs (libicu74, libxml2, libflite1)

---

## 2026-01-27 - US-001
- Installed @playwright/test and playwright as devDependencies
- Created playwright.config.ts at repo root
- Installed browser binaries via npx playwright install
- Files changed: package.json, package-lock.json, playwright.config.ts
- Regression test added: RT-001 (pre-existing)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - trip-planner-web is at /home/lcc/yopki/trip-planner-web
  - Commitlint enforces lowercase subject after type prefix
  - Arch Linux needs manual sudo for playwright system deps
---

## 2026-01-27 - US-002
- Configured 5 Playwright projects: desktop-chromium, desktop-firefox, desktop-webkit, mobile-pixel5, mobile-iphone12
- Desktop projects target localhost:3005, mobile projects target localhost:3006
- Added test:e2e, test:e2e:desktop, test:e2e:mobile scripts to package.json
- Files changed: playwright.config.ts, package.json
- Regression test added: RT-002 (pre-existing, updated command)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Commitlint rejects sentence-case subjects; use all lowercase after `feat:`
  - `npx playwright test --list` returns exit 1 when no test files exist
  - Desktop projects use testMatch: ['desktop/**', 'shared/**'], mobile uses ['mobile/**', 'shared/**']
